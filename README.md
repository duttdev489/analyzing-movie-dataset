### Project Overview

 The dataset contains movie records and our aim is to:

- Find  movies with high ratings and suggest good movies to watch

- Find only English movies among details of movies with more than 50 langauges.




### Learnings from the project

 -  The dataset contains 5 K records with  15 columns.
- The movies.csv file was read using csv reader and stored in list.
-  learnt how to store and read information from nested lists.
- worked with dictionaries and processing the information in dictionaries.



### Approach taken to solve the problem

 - I undersood the problem first and then verified and viewed the data 
-I validated the data and chose the necessary collections to process the same.
-Read and implemented the instructions
-Debugged the issues whenver required using print()


### Challenges faced

 - The  information about columns present in dataset were not provided. It was hard to guess the significance of each column. Raised a ticket with support as feedback.

-  Some important information was not provided like  in this query i.e. '" 'reviews_max'  that will have the name of the movie as key, and the maximum number of reviews as values." , here no information provied related to maximum number of reviews. I analyzed dataset again and again , then chose most related column for the same plus raised a ticket with support and that is still under evaluation.

### Additional pointers

 We should always spend good amount of time on understanding data and problem.
